============================================

This is a simple ray caster. It keeps a 2D map and the position of the camera,
along with its direction. For each frame it sends out "rays" evenly spaced
across the field of view. Each ray goes in a straight line until it hits a wall.
That section of wall is then displayed with a height based on how far the ray
travelled.

Currently, to run a demo, run these commands:

  make # If the binary has not been created yet
  ./raycast # Run the demo

This will load the map from the file 'example'. Look in there to see the file
format.
