============================================                                    
                                                                                
This is a simple ray caster. It keeps a 2D map and the position of the camera,  
along with its direction. For each frame it sends out "rays" evenly spaced      
across the field of view. Each ray goes in a straight line until it hits a      
wall. That section of wall is then displayed with a height based on how far the 
ray travelled.                                                                  
                                                                                
To run a demo, run these commands:                                              
                                                                                
  make # If the binary has not been created yet                                 
  ./raycast -M example # Run the demo                                           
                                                                                
This will load the map from the file 'example'. Look in there to see an example 
of the file format. All lines must be the same length and there must be exactly 
one capital 'P' in the file designating the player starting point.              
                                                                                
(This README is, in fact, a valid map.)
